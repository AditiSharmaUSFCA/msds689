# OO Search Engine Implementation

In [MSDS962](https://github.com/parrt/msds692/blob/master/hw/search.md) you learned how to create and use a hash table. You did so by using non-object-oriented programming; i.e., just a bunch of functions. In this homework, your will build an object-oriented version of your hash table by updating your original code base. You will see that the object-oriented version is much more user-friendly and that it behaves very much like the built-in `dict` class.

As you work on this project, working from your previous codebase, I encourage you reflect on:

* How easy is it to understand your code a few months later? 
* Do you regret not adding more comments?
* Would you use different variable names now?
* Could you improve your code, given your enhanced experience?

Create `HashTable` class.

# Deliverables

You must complete and add these to the root of your `oohtable-`*userid* repository in USF-MSDS689 organization.

* oohtable.py
* test_oohtable.py (copy this from starterkit unchanged)

Ultimately, you want the test results to look like the following:

```
