# OO Search Engine Implementation

In [MSDS962](https://github.com/parrt/msds692/blob/master/hw/search.md) you learned how to create and use a hash table. You did so by using non-object-oriented programming; just a bunch of functions. In this homework, your task is to build an object-oriented version of your hash table by updating your original code base.

You are encouraged to reuse your solution and reflect on:

* How easy is it to understand your code a few months later? 
* Do you regret not adding more comments?
* Would you use different variable names now?
* Could you improve your code given that you have more experience?

Create `HashTable` class.


# Deliverables

You must complete and add these to the root of your `oohtable-`*userid* repository in USF-MSDS689 organization.

* oohtable.py
* test_oohtable.py (copy this from starterkit unchanged)

Ultimately, you want the test results to look like the following:

```
```
